# Master Thesis Android Application
This github contains the application which was developed for our thesis work. It is a prototype of how the Bluetooth Smart technology can be used in a public transport system.

## Week log
The weeks are numbered as they are i the normal year, so week one would be the first week of the year 2016.

### Week five 
Last week our project plan was finished and this week started by conducting interviews with a certain number of people. The interviews only showed what we already suspected but will be a good method to show it in the final report. The beginning of the week also included continuing our research into the different technologies we will be using.

In the middle of the week we started setting up the environments we will be using to develop the prototypes. We installed Android Studios/IntelliJ and set up our project with github. In the end of the week we started developing for our usecases, finishing both the first and the second.
